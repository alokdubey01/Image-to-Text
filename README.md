# Image to Text

The image to text generator uses optical character recognition (OCR) algorithms to detect and extract text from an image. It then converts the extracted text into an editable form, such as a Word document, text file, or HTML page. It can be used to convert images of books, invoices, resumes, and other written material into searchable digital documents. It can also be used to extract text from images of signs, menus, and other printed material.
